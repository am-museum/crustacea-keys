(1989) also provide a glossary for terms used in isopod systematics.
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Aesthetasc.</strong> A long, tubular sensory seta having
thin cuticle, found on the antennula. Aesthetascs may have a chemosensory
function, because males generally have many more than females. 
	
				</p>

				<p>

segment bearing three setose lobes. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Maxilliped.
</strong>Paired appendage on
the posterior and ventral edge of the cephalon. Actually it is the first
thoracic appendage, but its body somite is fused into the cephalon, and it is
modified for feeding. It consists of the following functional parts: coxa,
basis bearing a flattened and setose endite, palp with 5 segments (ischium,

				<p>
		<strong>Natasomite.</strong> A pereonite of the natasome. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Oopore.</strong> A paired female opening in the
ventral cuticle of pereonite 5, through which the fertilised ova are released
via the oviduct into the marsupium. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Oostegites.
</strong>Lamellar lobes of
cuticle extending medially from the coxa of an adult female isopod. They may be
seen in two forms: developing oostegites are small fat lobes that do not cross
the ventral midline; oostegites of the brooding female are broad, long lamellae
that overlap on the ventral midline, forming a marsupium for the developing
embryos. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Operculum/Opercular.</strong> A covering/forming a covering.
For female Janiroidean asellotan isopods the operculum equates to a plate over the branchial chamber

absent in these isopods). 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Oviduct.</strong> An often complex female organ
connecting the ovaries to the oopores. In the Asellota, it consists of the
following functional subsections: outer tissues surrounding internal parts;
spermatheca, which may or may not be covered with cuticle; and cuticular organ,
an often complex cuticular tube. 
	
				</p>

		<strong>Paucisetose.</strong> Having few setae.
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Pedestal

seta that is raised above the dorsal surface of the body by a pedestal-like
outpocketing of the cuticle. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Penile
Papillae (or Penes).</strong>
Male cuticular projections on the posterior and medial margin of the seventh
pereonite. They contain the openings of the vasa deferentia. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Pereon.</strong> Thoracic segments 2-8 bearing the
locomotory appendages, or pereopods. (Thoracic segment 1 is part of the
cephalon and bears the maxilliped).

		<strong>Pereonite.</strong> A segment of the pereon. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Pereopod.</strong> One of the seven pereonal
appendages. Consists of the following segments: coxa, basis, ischium, merus,
carpus, propodus, dactylus. The coxa of adult female bears oostegites. The
distal five podomeres are homologous with the endopod of the more primitive
biramous thoracic limb of other Crustacea. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Pleotelson.
</strong>Segment resulting
from fusion of the sixth pleonite with the telson.
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Pleonite.</strong> A segment of the abdomen. Primitively in the Malacostraca there are six
free pleonites and a telson, in isopods the sixth pleonite is fused to the
telson to form a 'pleotelson'.
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Pleopod.</strong> One of the first five paired,
biramous, ventral limbs of the pleotelson. In unmodified form, it consists of a
basal segment, the protopod, and two distal rami, the endopod and the exopod.
The rami may be biarticulate. Female Asellota lack the first pleopods. In male
Asellota, the first pleopods are present only as uniramous structures (fused
into a single elongate plate in the superfamily Janiroidea). The rami of the
male second pleopod are modified as copulatory structures. Pleopods III-V have
very thin cuticle and function as gills (branchiae). 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Pleopodal
Cavity.</strong> The deeply
concave ventral surface of the pleotelson that encloses the pleopods dorsally
and laterally. Because the more posterior pleopods function as gills it is
sometimes called the branchial cavity. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Plumose
seta.</strong> A
feather-like seta that has two dense rows of thin, long setules beginning at
the base of the seta and continuing to the tip.

		<strong>Podomere.</strong> A segment of a crustacean
appendage. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Preanal
Ridge.</strong> A raised
transverse ridge on the ventral surface of the pleotelson situated between the
pleopodal (or branchial) cavity and the anus. In some munnopsoids, this ridge
becomes very large. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Prehensile.</strong> Adapted for clinging; dactylus
strongly recurved, acute, length usually subequal to or longer than propodus
(may be shorter than propodus in Epicaridean isopods).

Female.</strong> An adult
female that has developing oostegites. 
	
				</p>

				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Receptaculi

sometimes calcified cuticle. 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Sensilla.</strong> A modified seta found on the
dactylus of the pereopods. It is similar to an aesthetasc, but has a heavier
cuticle that is covered with many tiny lobes (often only visible in a scanning
electron micrograph). 
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Sensory
Pore, Mandibular Molar.</strong> A small pit in the distal surface of the mandible's molar process that
can be seen to connect internally to a nerve process.

denticles.
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Seta
(plural Setae).</strong> A
cuticular process that is clearly articulated with the basal cuticle. This
structure comes in many forms. There is a tendency in the literature for some
authors to call heavily sclerotized setae &quot;spines&quot;, even though they
have smaller counterparts of the same form named &quot;setae&quot; by the same
authors. &quot;Spinose seta&quot; or &quot;spine-like seta&quot; is more
accurate.
	
				</p>

				<p>
		<strong>Setulate
Seta.</strong> A seta with
one or more rows of setules. It is different from plumose or hemiplumose setae
in that the row is limited to a section of the shaft, and does not extend from
base to tip.

tube in the stylet (distal segment of the endopod) of the male second pleopod,
consisting of a ventral opening to a rounded chamber in the centre of the
stylet and a confluent tube to the tip of the stylet. 2. A cuticular tube
formed by the 
	
				</p>
