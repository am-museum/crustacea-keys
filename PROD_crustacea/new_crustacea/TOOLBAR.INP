character, by pressing ‘OK’. However, if you can see obvious difficulties in
using this character, select another by clicking on it, then pressing ‘OK’.

that applies to the specimen, and press ‘OK’. IF YOU ARE NOT SURE, DO NOT

\par{}\sb240{}The merit of a character is calculated partly from its
separating power, and partly from its ‘reliability’ or ease of use.
Characters are displayed in order of merit, and their separating powers are
shown at the left of the display. A separating power of 1 corresponds to a
division of the group of remaining taxa into halves, and a value of 0
indicates very poor separation."

subset of the characters, and then selecting individual characters from that
subset. Unless you are familiar enough with the data to know that certain
character states exhibited by your specimen are likely to eliminate a good
proportion of the taxa, \i{}at the current stage of the identification\i0{},
you should use the ‘Best’ button instead.
\par{}\sb240{}After you have selected a character, the program displays a
list of character states, or a box for entering values such as lengths.
