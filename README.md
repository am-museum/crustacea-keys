Crustacea Keys - Legacy Australian Museum project

There are 4 versions of the files: 

- ARCHIVE_crustacea.net – the master files, as is fetched from FTP 
- EDITED_crustacea.net – includes the master files, with some families key files already edited as they were specifically requested by the public 
- New-families – only the edited files requested by the public 
- PROD_crustacea.net - All project files with updated families
 
It is important to keep the file structure as is to keep track of which folders belong to which families, etc, since you’ll probably work on it by batches.
